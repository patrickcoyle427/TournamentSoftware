LatinQuizWidget.py - The meat of LatinQuiz. Creates and displays questions,
                     Keeps track of questions answers and controls what is
                     shown in LatinQuizMainWindow.

                     This is imported into LatinQuizMain window and is not
                     meant to be run by itself.

# TODO:

# Add an error message to import_words if the file isn't found

# Finish the layout of the game UI

#   In questions_answered:
#       Add some way to show which quesion is right and which is wrong,
#       as well as some indication of which question the user chose.
#       The idea so far is the correct answer will have a green border
#       and should say correct answer as well for color blind people.
#       if the incorrect answer is chosen that will have a red border and
#       say wrong answer.
#
#       Use this to change the color of the border:
#       yourWidget->setStyleSheet("border: 1px solid red")

# QDialog in quiz to show your final score and give
# player the option to export questions they got wrong
# so they can study. QUIZ NEEDS A WAY TO KNOW IT'S DONE!

# Keyboard shortcuts for answering questions.
# should be able to press A, B, C, D, or 1 2 3 4 for question answers
# and enter to advance to the next question.
